# Data-Visualization-with-R-and-GGobi
In this project I use visualiza tools (R and GGobi) to present a visual analysis of the cars and the Online Retail datasets.  
Then I use assiciation rule mining for the Online Retail data. Please see the [Report](https://github.com/EllaLiang/Data-Visualization-with-R-and-GGobi/blob/master/Report.pdf) for more details.
